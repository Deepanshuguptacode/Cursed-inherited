            <p>In a village  a few hundred years ago lived a powerful sorceress by the name Elira. The rich and powerful "Valor" family had wrongfully condemned her as a witch. Because of that, Elira got executed. Dying, Elira cursed the family that one person of each generation of the Valor should die in a tragic way before the age of 30. Centuries passed, and the curse always took one family member's life.</p>

            <h2 class="floating">Chapter 4: The Ritual</h2>
            <p>Ayla and Eli embark on a quest to discover a way to undo the curse. They figured that the only possible way to break the curse is a special counter-ritual at the place of Elira's execution. For this to happen, however, Eli will have to stand with the shadow and give a portion of his soul as an offering. If the ritual were to be performed wrongly, Eli would have to loose his life Eli realizes that he has no other choice but to take part in this ritual. He begins to prepare himself for the final battle and goes to the place where Elira died...a temple deep in the woods.</p>

            <p>As Eli starts the ritual, the shadow begins to writhe and convulse, its form weakening as the curse unravels. With every spoken word, Eli feels his life force ripped from him faster, more violently than before. His body seizes, collapsing to the ground, wracked with unbearable pain. Blood pools around him as his veins blacken and his skin tears apart. Eli’s screams echo through the air as his body is shredded—every bone fractured, every muscle destroyed. As the curse finally dissipates, it leaves behind only a lifeless, brutalized shell of what Eli once was. The curse is broken, but Eli is gone, his life violently claimed in its final moments.</p>
